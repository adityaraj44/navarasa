            Navarasa Creative is an initiative to get involved with the abundant
            creative talent in the indie-sphere. We are starting our journey
            with Tamil Music as it has been an integral part of our youth and
            continues to be a source of inspiration in our daily lives.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-white">
            As the Tamil music indie space blooms, our vision is to connect new
            talent with the more experienced artists in the community as well as
            the global online audiences.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-white">
            Conducting competitions with the ultimate aim of culminating in
            collaborations, we would like to see newer talent become part of the
            musical community; which has always been welcoming and nurturing
            toward the next generation of musicians.

            Songs are a great unifier. Trending songs come in so many flavours.
            From sick beats to killer baselines, from heart wrenching meladies
            to soulful vocals, music is practically infinite in itâ€™s nature.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-white">
            On a deeper level, music has a certain trancendental quality. It
            touches every listener in a unique way and has the ability to unite
            people beyond petty differences and disputes. When music is coupled
            with the right message and intent, it can be a powerful means to
            create joy, harmony and awareness.

          <p className="mt-4 text-white">
            No one goes untouched by the magic of music.
